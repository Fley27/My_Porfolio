            The "Collective" is a group of developers that work together if one of us gets stuck on a particular issue. 
            We are a diverse group of people that have strengths in many different areas. 
            Some of us are more focused on design while others are very strong at working with backend technologies.

            Generally this won't affect what I'm building for you, but it does ensure that your site will be reviewed
            by many other different developers before it goes live. 
            This gives us a chance to catch any bugs or issues that may 
            affect the user experience before your users get a chance to use the site.
